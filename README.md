The objective of this analysis is to understand user behavior and website performance by examining historical traffic data. This involves identifying trends, measuring engagement, and analyzing the relationships between key metrics such as unique visitors, page views, and bounce rate.

Website traffic data provides insights into how users interact with a site. The dataset consists of four main attributes: Date, which records the time of traffic activity; PageViews, representing the total number of pages viewed; UniqueVisitors, indicating the count of distinct users visiting the website; and BounceRate, which measures the percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page. Understanding these metrics helps in assessing website performance, detecting patterns in user behavior, and optimizing content to improve engagement.

This analysis is crucial for businesses and content creators as it enables them to track performance trends, evaluate the impact of marketing campaigns, and identify areas that require improvement. A high bounce rate, for instance, may indicate poor content quality, slow website speed, or a lack of user-friendly navigation. By visualizing traffic trends and computing correlations, we aim to uncover factors that influence user retention and engagement.

The expected outcomes of this study include graphical representations of traffic trends, correlation analysis between key metrics, and a structured report that can inform data-driven decisions. Future enhancements could include machine learning models for traffic prediction, anomaly detection for spotting unusual spikes or drops, and segmentation analysis based on time periods such as weekdays versus weekends. This comprehensive approach will help in optimizing website performance and improving user experience.
