The objective of this analysis is to understand user behavior and website performance by examining historical traffic data. This involves identifying trends, measuring engagement, and analyzing the relationships between key metrics such as Unique Visitors, Page Views, and Bounce Rate over time.

The dataset contains four key attributes: Date, which records the traffic activity on a specific day; PageViews, representing the total number of pages viewed on that date; UniqueVisitors, indicating the count of distinct users who visited the website; and BounceRate, which measures the percentage of visitors who left after viewing only one page. Analyzing these metrics helps in tracking website performance, identifying user engagement patterns, and optimizing content to retain visitors.

This analysis is essential for businesses, marketers, and content creators as it enables them to assess trends in web traffic, measure the effectiveness of marketing efforts, and pinpoint areas for improvement. A high bounce rate may indicate issues such as poor content quality, slow website performance, or ineffective user experience, while an increase in unique visitors and page views suggests growing audience interest. By visualizing traffic trends and computing correlations, we aim to uncover relationships between different factors affecting user engagement.

The expected outcomes of this study include time-series visualizations of Unique Visitors over time, correlation analysis between Page Views, Unique Visitors, and Bounce Rate, and a structured report that can help in data-driven decision-making. Future improvements could involve implementing machine learning models for predicting website traffic, anomaly detection for unusual traffic patterns, and segmentation analysis based on specific time periods (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends). These insights will ultimately help in optimizing website strategies and improving overall user experience.
